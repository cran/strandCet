\title{Prediction of Heligman-Pollard model.}
\usage{
HP.pred(life, HPout, M = "med", age = seq(0, 29, 0.1), rm = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{life}{A life table created with \link{life.tab} or a dataframe with a vector of ages in the first column.}

\item{HPout}{A model object created with \link{HP.mod} with the Heligman-Pollard estimated params.}

\item{M}{Defines the statistic to predict. Median by default (med), Low CI (low) or High CI (high)}

\item{age}{A vector containing the ages at which each age interval begins. See Details}

\item{rm}{The number of age classes that want to be removed from optimization.}
}
\value{
A dataframe with seven columns:
\item{age}{Age at the beginning of the interval.}
\item{Mx}{Number of observed deaths at age x.}
\item{qx.tot}{Total probability of death between ages x and x + n.}
\item{qx.nat}{Natural probability of death between ages x and x + n.}
\item{qx.young}{Young probability of death between ages x and x + n.}
\item{qx.risk}{Probability of death due to an externl risk between ages x and x + n.}
\item{qx.adult}{Adult or senescent probability of death between ages x and x + n.}
}
\description{
Predicts Heligman-Pollard model from Heligman-Pollard's parameters.
}
\details{
Mx is returned only if number of ages required for prediction is equal to the number of ages in the life table.
