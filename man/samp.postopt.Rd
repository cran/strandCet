\title{Multivariate Gaussian Sampling for Heligman-Pollard model estimated via Bayesian Melding.}
\usage{
samp.postopt(opt.cov.d, opt.mu.d, d.keep, prior, B = 400, B0 = 8000,
  d = 10)
}
\arguments{
\item{opt.cov.d}{An array containing a covariance matrix for each run of optimizer where the likelihood for that run exceeds the maximum likelihood from the prior.}

\item{opt.mu.d}{A matrix containing the results of the optimizer step.}

\item{d.keep}{Number of runs of optimizer where the likelihood for that run exceeds the maximum likelihood from the prior.}

\item{prior}{A matrix containing the prior distribution (see \link{HP.priors}).}

\item{B}{Sample size at the importance sampling stage.}

\item{B0}{Sample size of the prior. This is equal to (theta.dim * 1000).}

\item{d}{Number of optimizer iterations.}
}
\value{
\item{H.k}{The prior plus new samples.}
\item{H.new}{The new samples from the multivariate normal.}
\item{B1}{The number of new samples - should be equal to B * d.keep.}
}
\description{
Samples the nine Heligman-Pollard parameters from the mvnorm distribution for each run of optimizer step where the likelihood for that run exceeds the maximum likelihood from the prior.
