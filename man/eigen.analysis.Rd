\description{
Calculates the asymptotic growth rate and related quantities from a demographic projection matrix.
}
\details{
Calculates the asymptotic growth rate (lambda) of a population described by demographic projection
matrix A. The asymptotic growth rate of the population is given by the dominant eigenvalue
of the projection matrix. By the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, this eigenvalue is guaranteed to be
real, positive and strictly greater than all the other eigenvalues if the matrix A is non-negative,
irreducible, and primitive (for details see Caswell (2001)).

Also calculates the damping ratio (rho), eigenvalue sensitivities, eigenvalue elasticities, the stable
age distribution (for the communicating parts of the life cycle), and scaled reproductive values.

The damping ratio is the ratio of the dominant eigenvalue and the absolute value of the second
eigenvalue. rho is a measure of the rate of convergence to the stable age-distribution. A population
characterized by damping ratio rho will converge asymptotically to the stable age distribution exponentially
with rate at least as fast as log(rho). Clearly, a population already at or very near the
stable age distribution will converge faster, but rho provides an upper bound.

The eigenvalue sensitivities are the partial derivatives of lambda with respect to a perturbation in
matrix element $a_ij$. The sensitivities measure the selection gradient on the life-cycle (Lande 1982).
The eigenvalue elasticities are scaled to be proportional sensitivities of lambda to a perturbation
in $a_ij$. Elasticities have a number of desirable properties including, their sum across all
life-cycle transitions is unity and the sum of the elasticities of all incoming arcs to a life-cycle stage
must equal the sum of all outgoing arcs (van Groenendael et al 1994).

The stable age distribution is normalized to represent the proportion in each of the communicating
age classes. If the population is characterized by post-reproductive survival (and hence age classes
that do not communicate with the rest of the life cycle graph), then other methods should be used
to calculate to stable distribution. For example, from classic stable population theory, we know that
the stable age distribution of the population c(x) is given by the relationship:

c(x) = b l(x) exp(-r*x)

where b is the gross birth rate, l(x) is survivorship to age x and r is the rate of increase of the
population (=log(lambda)). See Coale (1972) or Preston et al. (2001) for details.

The age-specific reproductive values are normalized so that the reproductive value of the first age
class is unity. Problems associated with post-reproductive survival are irrelevant for reproductive
value since the reproductive value of post-reproductive individuals is, by definition, zero.
