\title{Caclulate net reproduction number from a demographic projection matrix.}
\usage{
calc.ro(A, N.out = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{A}{A demographic projection matrix}

\item{N.out}{Return the fundamental matrix (N) of the Markov chain.}
}
\value{
If the (default) option N.out=FALSE is used, the net reproduction number is returned as a single
value. If N.out = TRUE, the returned value is a list of two items:
\item{ro}{Net reproduction number.}
\item{N}{Fundamental matrix.}
}
\description{
Calculate the net reproduction number ($R_0$) from an age or stage-classified demographic projection matrix.
}
\details{
Calculates the net reproduction number ($R_0$) from an age or stage-classified demographic projection
matrix by first decomposing the k x k projection matrix A into two component matrices, T
and F. T collects the transitions between life-cycle stages while F collects the fertility transitions.
For an age-classified Leslie matrix, T will contain only the sub-diagonal of A and F will contain
only the first row of A. The fundamental matrix is given by $N = (I-T)^-1$, where I is a k x k
identity matrix. $R_0$ is the leading eigenvalue of the matrix FN.
