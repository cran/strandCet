#' @description
#' Calculates the asymptotic growth rate and related quantities from a demographic projection matrix.
#'
#' @param A Demographic projection matrix.
#'
#' @details
#' Calculates the asymptotic growth rate (lambda) of a population described by demographic projection
#' matrix A. The asymptotic growth rate of the population is given by the dominant eigenvalue
#' of the projection matrix. By the Perron-Frobenius Theorem, this eigenvalue is guaranteed to be
#' real, positive and strictly greater than all the other eigenvalues if the matrix A is non-negative,
#' irreducible, and primitive (for details see Caswell (2001)).
#'
#' Also calculates the damping ratio (rho), eigenvalue sensitivities, eigenvalue elasticities, the stable
#' age distribution (for the communicating parts of the life cycle), and scaled reproductive values.
#'
#' The damping ratio is the ratio of the dominant eigenvalue and the absolute value of the second
#' eigenvalue. rho is a measure of the rate of convergence to the stable age-distribution. A population
#' characterized by damping ratio rho will converge asymptotically to the stable age distribution exponentially
#' with rate at least as fast as log(rho). Clearly, a population already at or very near the
#' stable age distribution will converge faster, but rho provides an upper bound.
#'
#' The eigenvalue sensitivities are the partial derivatives of lambda with respect to a perturbation in
#' matrix element $a_ij$. The sensitivities measure the selection gradient on the life-cycle (Lande 1982).
#' The eigenvalue elasticities are scaled to be proportional sensitivities of lambda to a perturbation
#' in $a_ij$. Elasticities have a number of desirable properties including, their sum across all
#' life-cycle transitions is unity and the sum of the elasticities of all incoming arcs to a life-cycle stage
#' must equal the sum of all outgoing arcs (van Groenendael et al 1994).
#'
#' The stable age distribution is normalized to represent the proportion in each of the communicating
#' age classes. If the population is characterized by post-reproductive survival (and hence age classes
#' that do not communicate with the rest of the life cycle graph), then other methods should be used
#' to calculate to stable distribution. For example, from classic stable population theory, we know that
#' the stable age distribution of the population c(x) is given by the relationship:
#'
#' c(x) = b l(x) exp(-r*x)
#'
#' where b is the gross birth rate, l(x) is survivorship to age x and r is the rate of increase of the
#' population (=log(lambda)). See Coale (1972) or Preston et al. (2001) for details.
#'
#' The age-specific reproductive values are normalized so that the reproductive value of the first age
#' class is unity. Problems associated with post-reproductive survival are irrelevant for reproductive
#' value since the reproductive value of post-reproductive individuals is, by definition, zero.
